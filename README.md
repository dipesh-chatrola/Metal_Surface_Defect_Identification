# Metal_Surface_Defect_Identification üîç
The Project is for the Machine Learning subject. Project is on Metal surface defect identification where the CNN model is developed and by using that it can identify the defect.

**Data set details:** The NEU Surface Defect Dataset is used in this project, it includes six kinds of typical surface defects of the hot-rolled steel strip are collected, i.e., rolled-in scale (RS), patches (Pa), crazing (Cr), pitted surface (PS), inclusion (In) and scratches (Sc). The database contains 1,800 grayscale images: 300 samples each of six different kinds of typical surface defects.
Total there are three folders inside database, i.e., train, test, valid. The train folder contains six subfolders that have 236 image files in each folder. Accordingly, the test and valid contains six subfolders that have 32 images in each folder.

**Feature taken:** Image pixels as a feature

**Algorithms used:** I have used CNN Model. For improvement in accuracy and performance I have done hyperparameter tuning such as: activation function, learning rate, optimizer, kernel size, batch size and epochs.
